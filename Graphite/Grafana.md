 <u><h1 style="text-align:center">SETUP OF GRAFANA WITH GRAPHITE </h1></u>

 ## Task Requirement :
To track the status and performance of their IT infrastructure. It provides a centralized platform for monitoring hosts, services, and network devices.

## Environment Details :
**Os**- Ubuntu 20.04</br>
**Cpu**- 8 Core</br>
**Storage**- 1 TB</br>

## Prerequisites Tools :
1. Podman 
2. Grafana 
3. Graphite
   
### Some steps  for installing grafana and graphite on container</br>
#### 1. First we need to install podman by using this command.
```
apt install -y podman
```
**apt:** apt stands for "Advanced Package Tool. It is used to install, update, and manage software packages on the system.

**install:** This is the sub-command that tells apt to install a package. When you use apt install, you're instructing the package manager to download and install the specified software.

**-y:** This is an option flag that stands for "yes." It's used to automatically answer "yes" to any prompts that may come up during the installation process.

**podman:** This is the name of the package or software you want to install.

##### 2. After that make script file with name of .sh
```
vim test.sh
```

 **Vim:** It is an editor to create or edit a text file.

 **test.sh:** It is the name of script file.

#### 3. Now write a script for what you want to install.

Here I have created a pod with the name of **promgrafna** and two containers with their port.

**#!/bin/bash:** This line is called a shebang and specifies the interpreter to be used for the script.

**podman pod create:** This command creates a pod using Podman, a container management tool similar to Docker.

 **--name promgrafna:** The pod is named "promgrafna".

**--publish:** It specifies several ports to be published, making services running in containers accessible on those ports. 

**3002:3000 -** This allows you to access the service running in the container on port 3000 through your host system on port 3002 for grafana.
Â **8082:80** This port for graphite.

**2003-2004:2003-2004 -** This is typically used for the Carbon-cache service in Graphite, which handles incoming metric data.

**2023-2024:2023-2024  -** These ports are often used for the Carbon-relay service in Graphite.

**8125:8125/udp -** UDP is a transport protocol commonly used for metrics and data that can tolerate some loss in transit. Graphite StatsD, which is often used for collecting metrics, typically listens on this port.

**8126:8126 -** This port is sometimes used for administrative or management purposes in Graphite.

**podman run -d --pod promgrafna --name grafana grafana/grafana**

This command runs a container named "grafana" using the "grafana/grafana" image within the "promgrafna" pod.

**podman run -d --name graphite --pod promgrafna graphiteapp/graphite-statsd**

This command runs another container named "graphite" using the "graphiteapp/graphite-statsd" image within the same "promgrafna" pod.

#### 4. Now pod and container has installed.

```
podman ps -a
```

##### 6. Go to the web interface.

type **localhost:3002** for grafana's dashboard and  **localhost:8082** for graphite dashboard.

Then you will get grafana's dashboard and there you can put username and password.

**admin** is the default username and password and after that login grafana dashboard will come.
